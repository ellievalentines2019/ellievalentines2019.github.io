                    This song reminds gives me hope. It reminds me that the past is the past, and 
                    I hope it does the same for you. This song really makes me feel like moving forward.
                    Things really are "getting better all the time," Ellie, and I want to make this 
                    relationship the best it can be.

                I used to get mad at my school (No I can't complain)<br>
                The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No I can't complain)<br>
                You're holding me down (Oh), turning me round (Oh)<br>

                I used to be cruel to my woman<br>

                    It's funny how relatable this song is to me. <br>
                    I errantly found school a curse rather than a blessing.<br>
                    I was mad, annoyed, bored, and ungrateful. <br>
                    When I hear the intro to this song, I'm reminded of the ways <br>
                    You've opened my eyes to how truly blessed I am and made me <br>
                    a better, more grateful person.

                    This is a song that keeps me hopeful and reminds me of all you do for me. <br> 
                    Since you've been mine, I've smiled more, loved more and been the happiest <br>
                    I've ever felt. Thank you, Ellie, for giving me love, happiness, and hope.<br>

                    The word that you gave me was love. You showed me what love truly was and <br>
                    how to be loved, and for that I am forever grateful. Love is what inspires <br>
                    me to do better.

                    As I'm sure you know, I'm not proud of my past. In the past I know I've hurt <br>
                    you. I've made foolish, terrible decisions, and I acknowledge my mistakes. <br>
                    However, I also know that I'm growing as a person, more than ever before, <br>
                    and I really am doing the best that I can. <br>
