                    <i>The Office</i> was the first TV show we binged together. 
                    Some of my favorite hours have been spent on your couch with you, cuddling, laughing,
                    and crying over this amazing show. I loved dancing to this song with you, and 
                    every time I hear it, it reminds me of the wonderful times we've had watching 
                    shows together.

                    Can't count the years on one hand<br>
                    That we've been together<br>
                    I need the other one to hold you<br>
                    Make you feel, make you feel better<br>
                    <br>
                    It's not a walk in the park<br>
                    To love each other<br>
                    But when our fingers interlock,<br>
                    Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it<br>
                    'Cause after all this time I'm still into you<br>
                    <br>
                    I should be over all the butterflies<br>
                    But I'm into you (I'm into you)<br>
                    And baby even on our worst nights<br>
                    I'm into you (I'm into you)<br>
                    <br>
                    Let 'em wonder how we got this far<br>
                    'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all<br>
                    Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you<br>
                    <br>
                    Recount the night that<br>
                    I first met your mother<br>
                    And on the drive back to my house<br>
                    I told you that, I told you that I loved ya<br>
                    <br>
                    You felt the weight of the world<br>
                    Fall off your shoulder<br>
                    And to your favorite song<br>
                    We sang along to the start of forever<br>
                    And after all this time I'm still into you<br>
                    <br>
                    I should be over all the butterflies<br>
                    But I'm into you (I'm into you)<br>
                    And baby even on our worst nights<br>
                    I'm into you (I'm into you)<br>
                    Let 'em wonder how we got this far<br>
                    'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all<br>
                    Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you<br>
                    <br>
                    Some things just, some things just make sense<br>
                    And one of those is you and I (Hey)<br>
                    Some things just, some things just make sense<br>
                    And even after all this time (Hey)<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm into you, baby, not a day goes by<br>
                    That I'm not into you<br>
                    <br>
                    I should be over all the butterflies<br>
                    But I'm into you (I'm into you)<br>
                    And baby even on our worst nights<br>
                    I'm into you (I'm into you)<br>
                    Let 'em wonder how we got this far<br>
                    <br>
                    'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all<br>
                    Yeah, after all this time<br>
                    I'm still into you<br>
                    I'm still into you<br>
                    I'm still into you

                    Whether it be <i>Parks and Recreation</i>, <i>Steven Universe</i> or <i>Avatar</i>, 
                    one of my favorite things about watching shows with you is the fact that we always
                    dance and sing along to the intros. It's just so cute and fun!
