                    I know this song might be a bit of a shock, but really it's a blast. This is one
                    that I'd love to roll the windows down in the car and scream along to with you because
                    it's got such a rocking chorus and its message of love is one I really feel for you.
                    If you ever doubt that I love you, just listen to this song and remember that I
                    reall am "Still Into You," Ellie.

                    It's not a walk in the park<br>
                    To love each other<br>
                    But when our fingers interlock,<br>

                    'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all<br>
                    Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you<br>

                    Recount the night that<br>
                    I first met your mother<br>
                    And on the drive back to my house<br>
                    I told you that, I told you that I loved ya<br>
                    </span>
                    <br>
                    You felt the weight of the world<br>
                    Fall off your shoulder<br>
                    And to your favorite song<br>
                    We sang along to the start of forever<br>
                    And after all this time I'm still into you<br>

                    <br>
                    Some things just, some things just make sense<br>
                    And one of those is you and I (Hey)<br>
                    Some things just, some things just make sense<br>
                    And even after all this time (Hey)<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm into you, baby, not a day goes by<br>
                    That I'm not into you<br>

                    We've been together for a long time, and this time that I've spent with you
                    has been the happiest of my life. Thank you for these amazing 2 and a half years,
                    and I hope that we get to the point where we really can't count the years on one 
                    hand.

                    In this relationship, I want to be a supportive boyfriend. I want to be able
                    to hold you, comfort you, reassure you, and make you feel better.
                </span>
                <span id="c" breaks=6>
                    This relationship, as with all relationships, has had its share of ups and downs.
                    However, when we embrace, when I hold you close and feel you against me, I know 
                    that I'm in it for the right reasons. The love I feel for you when I hold you is 
                    indescribable, and I love you beyond words. You're more than worth it to me.
                </span>
                <span id="d" breaks=12>
                    This chorus goes hard! I love the upbeat, happy, truly loving vibe I get from this song,
                    and I hope it's able to put you in a good mood too, Ellie. If you ever wonder if I 
                    "still like you," just listen to this song and know that I'm always into you. I truly 
                    still get butterflies when I see you. I truly still love you. My feelings for you will 
                    never change.
                </span>
                <span id="e" breaks=21>
                    We've had a lot of firsts in this relationship, and I know we've both been nervous, 
                    but with each step we take our love grows stronger and stronger. I'm so proud of us 
                    for building this awesome relationship. I love you, Ellie.
