                    This song really captures who I want to be in this relationship. I want to be your 
                    mirror. I want to remind you of who you are, Ellie, because you're a shining, beautiful
                    light in the world. I want to remind you who awesome you are and be supportive of you.

                    I&#039;ll be your mirror<br />
                    Reflect what you are, in case you don&#039;t know<br /> </span>
                    <span class=textc>
                    I&#039;ll be the wind, the rain and the sunset<br />
                    The light on your door to show that you&#039;re home</span><br />

                    When you think the night has seen your mind<br />
                    That inside you&#039;re twisted and unkind<br />
                    Let me stand to show that you are blind<br />
                    Please put down your hands<br />
                    &#039;Cause I see you<br /> </span>
                    <br />
                    I find it hard to believe you don&#039;t know<br />
                    The beauty that you are<br /> <span class=textc>
                    But if you don&#039;t, let me be your eyes<br />
                    A hand in your darkness, so you won&#039;t be afraid<br /></span>

                    That inside you&#039;re twisted and unkind<br />
                    Let me stand to show that you are blind<br />

                    Ellie, you're so beautiful, inside and out. You are a queen. You are lovely and kind and compassionate
                    and caring. You're cute and sexy and fun and awesome. You are the best thing on this earth, and if you
                    don't know it, I want to always remind you.
                </span>
                <span id="c" breaks=3>
                    In this relationship, I want to be a constant. I want to constantly remind you of your beauty, and 
                    I'm always going to let you know that you can find comfort in me. Know that I won't let you down.
                </span>

                    There are times when you are sad; you feel inadequate or like you're not enough. I want to remind you
                    that not only are you enough, you're amazing. You're better than enough and every day you are a kind,
                    loving, amazing, beautiful girlfriend. You do so much for me, and I can thank you by reminding you of how
                    truly awesome and special you are.
