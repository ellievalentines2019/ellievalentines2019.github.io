                    That inside you&#039;re twisted and unkind<br />
                    Let me stand to show that you are blind<br />
                    Please put down your hands<br />

                    The beauty that you are<br /> </span> <span class=textc>
                    But if you don&#039;t, let me be your eyes<br />
                    A hand in your darkness, so you won&#039;t be afraid<br /></span>

                    In the time we've known each other, I've broken down in front of your more times than I can count.
                    There are nights when I would cry and cry and these vulnerable moments with you have strengthened
                    our bond.

                <span id="c" breaks=3>
                    Even when I'm feeling really down, you always know the right thing to say to cheer me up. You're
                    such a kind and loving soul and I am truly grateful to have you in my life. Thank you for always
                    being there for me.
