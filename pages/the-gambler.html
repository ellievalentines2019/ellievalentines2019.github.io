                    <i>The Office</i> was the first TV show we binged together. 
                    Some of my favorite hours have been spent on your couch with you, cuddling, laughing,
                    and crying over this amazing show. I loved dancing to this song with you, and 
                    every time I hear it, it reminds me of the wonderful times we've had watching 
                    shows together.

                Slow down, we've got time left to be lazy<br>
                All the kids have bloomed from babies into flowers in our eyes<br>
                We've got fifty good years left to spend out in the garden<br>
                I don't care to beg your pardon, we should live until we die<br>
                <br>
                We were barely eighteen when we crossed collective hearts<br>
                It was cold, but it got warm when you barely crossed my eye<br>
                And then you turned, put out your hand, and you asked me to dance<br>
                I knew nothing of romance, but it was love at second sight<br>
                <br>
                I swear when I grow up I won't just buy you a rose<br>
                I will buy the flower shop, and you will never be lonely<br>
                For even if the sun stops waking up over the fields<br>
                I will not leave, I will not leave 'til it's our time<br>
                So just take my hand, you know that I will never leave your side<br>
                <br>
                It was the winter of '86, all the fields had frozen over<br>
                So we moved to Arizona to save our only son<br>
                And now he's turned into a man, though he thinks just like his mother<br>
                He believes we're all just lovers, he sees hope in everyone<br>
                <br>
                And even though she moved away, we always get calls from our daughter<br>
                She has eyes just like her father's, they are blue when skies are gray<br>
                And just like him she never stops, never takes the day for granted<br>
                Works for everything that's handed to her, never once complains<br>
                <br>
                You think that I nearly lost you when the doctors tried to take you away<br>
                Like the night you took my hand beside the fire thirty years ago to this day,<br>
                You swore you'd be here 'til we decide that it's our time<br>
                But it's not time, you never quit in all your life<br>
                So just take my hand, you know that I will never leave your side<br>
                You're the love of my life, you know that I will never leave your side<br>
                <br>
                You come home from work, and you kiss me on the eye<br>
                You curse the dog, you say that I should never feed them what is ours<br>
                So we move out to the garden, look at everything we've grown<br>
                And the kids are coming home so I'll set the table; you can make the fire

                    Whether it be <i>Parks and Recreation</i>, <i>Steven Universe</i> or <i>Avatar</i>, 
                    one of my favorite things about watching shows with you is the fact that we always
                    dance and sing along to the intros. It's just so cute and fun!
