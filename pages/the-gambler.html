                   You give this song a special place in my heart. From the first time I heard you play and sing it I was so 
                   amazed at your talent. Now when I listen to this song, I'm reminded not only of your beautiful voice and 
                   skills, but also of the beautiful message this song carries. It is a story of true love, and that's what we 
                   share. I wanted to put this song on your mixtape to remind you just how much I love you and how full, deep,
                   and infinitely that love for you is.

                Slow down, we've got time left to be lazy<br>
                All the kids have bloomed from babies into flowers in our eyes<br>
                We've got fifty good years left to spend out in the garden<br>
                I don't care to beg your pardon, we should live until we die<br>
                <br>
                <span class=texta>
                We were barely eighteen when we crossed collective hearts<br>
                It was cold, but it got warm when you barely crossed my eye<br>
                And then you turned, put out your hand, and you asked me to dance<br>
                I knew nothing of romance, but it was love at second sight<br> </span>
                <br>
                <span class=textb>
                I swear when I grow up I won't just buy you a rose<br>
                I will buy the flower shop, and you will never be lonely<br>
                For even if the sun stops waking up over the fields<br>
                I will not leave, I will not leave 'til it's our time<br>
                So just take my hand, you know that I will never leave your side<br>
                </span>
                <br>
                It was the winter of '86, all the fields had frozen over<br>
                So we moved to Arizona to save our only son<br>
                And now he's turned into a man, though he thinks just like his mother<br>
                He <span class=textc>believes we're all just lovers, he sees hope in everyone</span><br>
                <br>
                And even though she moved away, we always get calls from our daughter<br>
                She has eyes just like her father's, they are blue when skies are gray<br>
                And just like him <span class=textc>she never stops, never takes the day for granted<br>
                Works for everything that's handed to her, never once complains </span> <br>
                <br>
                You think that I nearly lost you when the doctors tried to take you away<br>
                Like the night you took my hand beside the fire thirty years ago to this day,<br>
                <span class=textb>
                You swore you'd be here 'til we decide that it's our time<br>
                But it's not time, you never quit in all your life<br>
                So just take my hand, you know that I will never leave your side<br>
                You're the love of my life, you know that I will never leave your side<br> </span>
                <br>
                <span class=textd>
                You come home from work, and you kiss me on the eye<br>
                You curse the dog, you say that I should never feed them what is ours<br>
                So we move out to the garden, look at everything we've grown<br>
                And the kids are coming home so I'll set the table; you can make the fire </span>
            </div>
            <div class="anno">

                    Our love story is pretty unique. We met when we were young and although it took us a bit
                    to find each other, our romance has taught me what it means to love and be loved.
                </span>
                <span id=b breaks=11>
                    The chorus is full of promises and these are the promises that I want to make to you. I will never
                    abandon you. I will always be by your side. I want to make the grand romantic gestures talked about here.
                    I want to give you both small reminders of my love like flowers and I want to give you big gestures too.
                    I truly want to give you everything because my love for you is so great.
                </span>
                <span id=c breaks=20>
                    These traits are some of the things I admire most about you. Ellie, you're the most bright-eyed, 
                    loving, and caring person who I've ever met. These lines remind me of one of the serious talks we
                    had in the parking lot of Citrus Plaza. I remember how you told me how grateful you are, and how
                    grateful I should be for what I've been given. How complaining gets me nowhere. Your advice and your
                    outlook on life have made me realize the wonderful life that I have. Thank you for helping me become
                    a better person.
                </span>
                <span id=d breaks=34>
                    This is what we're working toward. Someday, I want to come home from work and kiss you. I want to
                    set the table and you can make the fire for our kids. I want to share my whole life with you because you're
                    the most beautiful and amazing girl I've ever met, and you're only one I want.
