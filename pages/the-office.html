                    <i>The Office</i> was the first TV show we binged together. 
                    Some of my favorite hours have been spent on your couch with you, cuddling, laughing,
                    and crying over this amazing show. I loved dancing to this song with you, and 
                    every time I hear it, it reminds me of the wonderful times we've had watching 
                    shows together.

                    Whether it be <i>Parks and Recreation</i>, <i>Steven Universe</i> or <i>Avatar</i>, 
                    one of my favorite things about watching shows with you is the fact that we always
                    dance and sing along to the intros. It's just so cute and fun!
