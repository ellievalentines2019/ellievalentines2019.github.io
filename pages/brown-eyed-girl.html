                    From the moment I first heard this song, I knew it would forever remind me of you.
                    The heartfelt acts of kindness that you've shown me throughout the course of our
                    relationship have kept my demons at bay and made me realize that I am worth something
                    and I have realized my own worth and grown as a person. Thank you for all of your love
                    for me, Ellie. You've shown me what it's like to be loved and to be in love and for that
                    I couldn't be more grateful.

                    Hey, where did we go<br>
                    Days when the rains came<br>
                    Down in the hollow<br>
                    Playing a new game,<br>
                    Laughing and a-running, hey, hey,<br>
                    Skipping and a-jumping<br>
                    In the misty morning fog with<br>
                    Our, our hearts a-thumping<br>
                    And you, my brown-eyed girl,<br>
                    You, my brown-eyed girl.<br>
                    <br>
                    Whatever happened<br>
                    To Tuesday and so slow<br>
                    Going down to the old mine with a<br>
                    Transistor radio.<br>
                    Standing in the sunlight laughing<br>
                    Hide behind a rainbow's wall,<br>
                    Slipping and a-sliding<br>
                    All along the waterfall<br>
                    With you, my brown-eyed girl,<br>
                    You, my brown-eyed girl.<br>
                    <br>
                    Do you remember when we used to sing<br>
                    Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah<br>
                    Just like that<br>

                    So hard to find my way<br>
                    Now that I'm all on my own.<br>
                    I saw you just the other day,<br>
                    My, how you have grown!<br>
                    Cast my memory back there, Lord,<br>
                    Sometime I'm overcome thinking about<br>
                    Making love in the green grass<br>
                    Behind the stadium<br>
                    With you, my brown-eyed girl,<br>
                    You, my brown-eyed girl.<br>
                    <br>
                    Do you remember when we used to sing<br>
                    Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah<br>
                    Laying in the green grass<br>
                    Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah<br>
                    Dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee<br>

                    In the time we've known each other, I've broken down in front of your more times than I can count.
                    There are nights when I would cry and cry and these vulnerable moments with you have strengthened
                    our bond.
