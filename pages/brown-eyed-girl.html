                    You introduced me to this song and I know it will always remind me of you. When we were 
                    coming back from Christmas service and you mentioned this song, I just knew I had to put
                    it on this tape. This song reminds me of all the amazing times we've had and encourages 
                    me to continue to make these moments with you special.

                    PS: "You!" *bangs head awkwardly*

                    <span class=textb>
                    Days when the rains came<br>
                    Down in the hollow<br>
                    Playing a new game,<br>
                    Laughing and a-running, hey, hey,<br>
                    Skipping and a-jumping<br>
                    In the misty morning fog with<br>
                    Our, our hearts a-thumping<br> </span>

                    Going down to the old mine with a<br>
                    Transistor radio.<br>
                    Standing in the sunlight laughing<br>
                    Hide behind a rainbow's wall,<br>
                    Slipping and a-sliding<br>
                    All along the waterfall<br> </span>

                    So hard to find my way<br>
                    Now that I'm all on my own.<br>
                    I saw you just the other day,<br>
                    My, how you have grown!<br>
                    Cast my memory back there, Lord,<br>
                    Sometime I'm overcome thinking about<br>
                    Making love in the green grass<br>
                    Behind the stadium<br> </span>

                    Recently, I've had some time to reflect on our relationship, and I really don't know where I'd be without you.
                    I'm so grateful to have you in my life, and I hope that we'll always be togther so that we can 
                    continue to make these amazing memories together.

                    Our relationship has been filled with some of the best times of my life, so I wanted to use each of the 
                    verses as a place to reflect on some of my favorite memories with you like Van Morrison does. Do you remember 
                    that night that we saw Blind Pilot downtown in LA for the first time? I remember being so excited I really couldn't
                    believe that I was going to see my favorite band with my favorite person in the whole world. I was so excited!
                    I remember I brought a different phone with a better camera so I could take pictures of you and me there. The 
                    show was so amazing and I remember afterward we stayed for their second set with your family! That day was the best 
                    day of my life up to that point, and I still think fondly of it. Thank you for being a part of my life and 
                    making my days so special and amazing.

                    You, Ellie, are my brown eyed girl and you always will be. You're the one I love and I want to be with you 
                    for always.

                    Another one of my favorite memories with you has to be Disneyland. I remember how early we got up to go.
                    You said you'd keep me company on the drive, but about 30 minutes into the drive on the way I looked over 
                    to see you dead asleep. Same thing on the way back! You look so beautiful and peaceful as you slept and I drove us faithfully to Anaheim. 
                    Once in the park, we had an amazing day where we raced in Cars, looked at the overpriced Mickey and Minnie ears 
                    (And the $40 pizza!!), and we had a blast going around the park getting our pictures taken as often as possible. 
                    The photos of Disneyland are some of my favorite to look back on because I can truly tell how happy you looked. 
                    I love you and thank you for sharing these happy memories with me.

                    This relationship has been filled with awesome memories of the happiest times of my life. Thank you, Ellie
                    for giving me such an amazing time and for sharing so many happy memories with me. From sitting on the couch 
                    watching TV or movies together to playing games to going on dates, all the time I've spent with you has been  
                    amazing and you've truly given me that happiest years of my life.
