                    This song always makes me so happy. It's upbeat, it's funky, and the flying guitar
                     solos never fail to make my head nod to the beat and bring a smile to my face. 
                     The lyrics talk of a new, different, better love, and that's exactly what you've
                      shown me. You make loving fun, Ellie, and this is a fun song that I love to sing
                       along to when I think about you.

                    Sweet, wonderful you.<br>
                    You make me happy with the things you do.<br>

                    I never did believe in miracles,<br>
                    But I've a feeling it's time to try.<br>
                    I never did believe in the ways of magic,<br>
                    But I'm beginning to wonder why.<br>

                    Ellie, you are sweet, beautiful, and wonderful. Waking up next to you every morning 
                    puts a smile on my face, and being around you makes my days phenomenal. You really 
                    do make me happy with everything you do.

                <span id="b" breaks=3>
                    Often I find myself wondering how or why you chose me. I'm sometimes in genuine 
                    disbelief that you, the most beautiful girl in the world, chose to be with me. 
                    It's like a dream to be with you because you're just too good to be true. You're 
                    beautiful, sexy, smart, and funny. You really have it all, babe, and I don't know 
                    how I am so lucky to be with you. 
                </span>
                <span id="c" breaks=6>
                    Before I met you, love was something I didn't know. I didn't know I could be so happy.
                     I didn't know love could be so pure. You showed me that love is never-ending care and
                      affection. Love is selfless and warm and wholesome. Love is magic, and I'm so 
                      grateful to be able to experience it with you.
                </span>
                <span id="d" breaks=16>
                    I haven't been the perfect boyfriend in this relationship, but I won't let this 
                    love die. The love I feel for you burns like a fire in my heart, and I won't let 
                    the spell be broken. Things will be different between us, and this relationship will
                     make both of us the happiest we've been. I promise.

                    When I wake up in the morning, you're the first thing on my mind. Throughout the day
                     I often daydream about you in class or I think about coming home and wrapping my
                      arms around you. You're the only one on my mind and you're the only one I want.
                       When I'm with you it's like the whole world melts away and it's just the two of us. 
                       I love that feeling.
