                    <i>The Office</i> was the first TV show we binged together. 
                    Some of my favorite hours have been spent on your couch with you, cuddling, laughing,
                    and crying over this amazing show. I loved dancing to this song with you, and 
                    every time I hear it, it reminds me of the wonderful times we've had watching 
                    shows together.

                    Sweet, wonderful you.<br>
                    You make me happy with the things you do.<br>
                    Oh, can it be so?<br>
                    This feeling follows me wherever I go.<br>
                    <br>
                    I never did believe in miracles,<br>
                    But I've a feeling it's time to try.<br>
                    I never did believe in the ways of magic,<br>
                    But I'm beginning to wonder why.<br>

                    <br>
                    Don't, don't break the spell.<br>
                    It would be different, and you know it will.<br>
                    You, you make loving fun,<br>
                    And I don't have to tell you, but you're the only one.<br>
                    <br>
                    You, you make loving fun.<br>

                    Whether it be <i>Parks and Recreation</i>, <i>Steven Universe</i> or <i>Avatar</i>, 
                    one of my favorite things about watching shows with you is the fact that we always
                    dance and sing along to the intros. It's just so cute and fun!
