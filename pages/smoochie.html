                    From the moment I first heard this song, I knew it would forever remind me of you.
                    The heartfelt acts of kindness that you've shown me throughout the course of our
                    relationship have kept my demons at bay and made me realize that I am worth something
                    and I have realized my own worth and grown as a person. Thank you for all of your love
                    for me, Ellie. You've shown me what it's like to be loved and to be in love and for that
                    I couldn't be more grateful.

                    In the time we've known each other, I've broken down in front of your more times than I can count.
                    There are nights when I would cry and cry and these vulnerable moments with you have strengthened
                    our bond.
