                    <i>The Office</i> was the first TV show we binged together. 
                    Some of my favorite hours have been spent on your couch with you, cuddling, laughing,
                    and crying over this amazing show. I loved dancing to this song with you, and 
                    every time I hear it, it reminds me of the wonderful times we've had watching 
                    shows together.

                When my personal demons are screaming<br>
                And when my door of madness is half-open<br>
                <br>
                You stand alongside<br>
                And say something to the effect that everything'll be<br>
                Alright<br>
                Soon<br>
                Smoochie<br>
                <br>
                Chaos attends to creation<br>
                And when the shadows inside me vie for attention<br>
                <br>
                You stand alongside<br>
                And say something perfect like &quot;concealment feeds the fear.&quot;<br>
                And hand me a sea peach<br>
                And say, &quot;Come, come over here<br>
                Smoochie.&quot;

                    Whether it be <i>Parks and Recreation</i>, <i>Steven Universe</i> or <i>Avatar</i>, 
                    one of my favorite things about watching shows with you is the fact that we always
                    dance and sing along to the intros. It's just so cute and fun!
