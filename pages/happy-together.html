                    <i>The Office</i> was the first TV show we binged together. 
                    Some of my favorite hours have been spent on your couch with you, cuddling, laughing,
                    and crying over this amazing show. I loved dancing to this song with you, and 
                    every time I hear it, it reminds me of the wonderful times we've had watching 
                    shows together.

                    Imagine me and you, I do<br>
                    I think about you day and night<br>
                    It's only right<br>
                    To think about the girl you love<br>
                    And hold her tight<br>
                    So happy together<br>
                    <br>
                    If I should call you up, invest a dime<br>
                    And you say you belong to me<br>
                    And ease my mind<br>
                    Imagine how the world could be<br>
                    So very fine<br>
                    So happy together<br>
                    <br>
                    I can't see me loving nobody but you for all my life<br>
                    When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life<br>
                    <br>
                    Me and you and you and me<br>
                    No matter how they tossed the dice<br>
                    It had to be<br>
                    The only one for me is you<br>
                    And you for me<br>
                    So happy together<br>
                    <br>
                    I can't see me loving nobody but you for all my life<br>

                    So happy together<br>
                    How is the weather?<br>
                    So happy together<br>
                    We're happy together<br>
                    So happy together<br>
                    We're happy together<br>
                    So happy together<br>

                    Whether it be <i>Parks and Recreation</i>, <i>Steven Universe</i> or <i>Avatar</i>, 
                    one of my favorite things about watching shows with you is the fact that we always
                    dance and sing along to the intros. It's just so cute and fun!
