                    "Happy Together" is a fun, upbeat song that reminds me of the way I've felt about 
                    you for a long time. Before we got together, and even since then, I've long day-dreamt about us being together. I've dreamt about holding you, about you being 
                     mine, and about how happy you make me. To this day, you still bring me the same 
                     joy you've always brought me, but now I care more deeply about you too. I don't 
                     just want you for myself; I want to show you off to the whole world and I want
                      you to grow. This song is a testament to the evolution of my love for you and 
                      to our happiness to come.

                    Imagine me and you, I do<br>
                    I think about you day and night<br>
                    It's only right<br>
                    To think about the girl you love<br>
                    And hold her tight<br>
                    So happy together<br> </span>

                    And you say you belong to me<br>
                    And ease my mind<br>
                    Imagine how the world could be<br>
                    So very fine<br>

                        I think about you all the time; you're the one thing on my mind. What is that 
                        beautiful girl doing running around? You run circles in my head all day and 
                        I'm always fantasizing about how beautiful you look sitting in class or 
                        drinking coffee. I can't believe you're mine. 
                    </span>
                <span id="b" breaks=8>
                        Asking you out was so stressful. Easily it was the most nervous I've ever been 
                        in my life. When you said you'd go out with me I was so relieved and happy I 
                        could almost cry. I wanted to kiss you right then. 
                </span>
                <span id=c breaks=16>
                    You have given me the happiest years and moments in my life. Whenever we're together 
                    I'm truly happy, and I hope you are too. I hope we get to continue making each other 
                    happy for the rest of ours lives.
