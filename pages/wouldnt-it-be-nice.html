                    From the moment I first heard this song, I knew it would forever remind me of you.
                    The heartfelt acts of kindness that you've shown me throughout the course of our
                    relationship have kept my demons at bay and made me realize that I am worth something
                    and I have realized my own worth and grown as a person. Thank you for all of your love
                    for me, Ellie. You've shown me what it's like to be loved and to be in love and for that
                    I couldn't be more grateful.

                    Wouldn't it be nice if we were older<br>
                    Then we wouldn't have to wait so long<br>
                    And wouldn't it be nice to live together<br>
                    In the kind of world where we belong<br>
                    <br>
                    You know it's gonna make it that much better<br>
                    When we can say goodnight and stay together<br>
                    <br>
                    Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up<br>
                    In the morning when the day is new<br>
                    And after having spent the day together<br>
                    Hold each other close the whole night through<br>
                    <br>
                    Happy times together we've been spending<br>
                    I wish that every kiss was neverending<br>
                    Wouldn't it be nice<br>
                    <br>
                    Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true<br>
                    Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do<br>
                    We could be married (we could be married)<br>
                    And then we'd be happy (and then we'd be happy)<br>
                    <br>
                    Wouldn't it be nice<br>
                    <br>
                    You know it seems the more we talk about it<br>
                    It only makes it worse to live without it<br>
                    But lets talk about it<br>
                    Wouldn't it be nice<br>
                    <br>
                    Good night my baby<br>
                    Sleep tight my baby<br>
                    Good night my baby<br>
                    Sleep tight my baby<br>
                    Good night my baby<br>
                    Sleep tight my baby ...

                    In the time we've known each other, I've broken down in front of your more times than I can count.
                    There are nights when I would cry and cry and these vulnerable moments with you have strengthened
                    our bond.
