                    This song perfectly captures how I've felt all throughout high school and before
                     you moved to San Diego. During the winter break I felt it too. This song captures
                      the moment I leave your house and drive home down Marion. I'm so happy that I've 
                      spent such lovely quality time with you. I love seeing your face. I love hearing
                       your voice. I love kissing you. I love spending all the time in the world with 
                       you, and it's a bittersweet feeling to leave and drive home at night. I would 
                       sit in my car with a huge smile on my face on the way home and wish for a time
                        where we could spend both the days and nights together. Now that time is here,
                         and this song reminds me how lucky we are to be able to spend these nights
                        together.

                    Wouldn't it be nice if we were older<br>
                    Then we wouldn't have to wait so long<br>
                    And wouldn't it be nice to live together<br>
                    In the kind of world where we belong<br>
                    <br>
                    <span class=texta>
                    You know it's gonna make it that much better<br>
                    When we can say goodnight and stay together<br> </span>
                    <br>
                    <span class=textb>
                    Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up<br>
                    In the morning when the day is new<br>
                    And after having spent the day together<br>
                    Hold each other close the whole night through<br>
                    </span>
                    <br>
                    <span class=textc>
                    Happy times together we've been spending<br>
                    I wish that every kiss was neverending<br>
                    Wouldn't it be nice<br>
                    </span>
                    <br>
                    Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true<br>
                    Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do<br>
                    <span class=textd>
                    We could be married (we could be married)<br>
                    </span>
                    And then we'd be happy (and then we'd be happy)<br>
                    <br>
                    Wouldn't it be nice<br>
                    <br>
                    You know it seems the more we talk about it<br>
                    It only makes it worse to live without it<br>
                    But lets talk about it<br>
                    Wouldn't it be nice<br>
                    <br>
                    Good night my baby<br>
                    Sleep tight my baby<br>
                    Good night my baby<br>
                    Sleep tight my baby<br>
                    Good night my baby<br>
                    Sleep tight my baby ...

                    In high school, we'd always call on the phone during the night so that we could
                    always be together, but really I wished desparately for the day when I got to
                    be in your bed the whole night too.
                </span>
                <span id="b" breaks=9>
                    These days with you are timeless. I love spending the whole day with you, and then
                    spending the whole night together too. Sometimes, I'll look at my text messages with
                    you and we haven't texted for a few days because we've just been spending every 
                    moment together. I love that so much! I love always being around you.
                    Spending the night with you is amazing. Every night that I get to crawl in bed
                    and hold you in my arms is another night where I'm happy. I'm so lucky to be able
                    to hold you close the whole night through.

                <span id=c breaks=14>
                    I love kissing you. From our very first kiss to our most recent, I always love the 
                    feeling of intimacy and your soft lips on mine. I love holding you close and being
                    romantic with you. Your kisses are the best.
                </span>
                <span id=d breaks=20>
                    Some day I hope that we're married with beautiful children, a lovely dog, and 
                    that big pile of leaves in our front yard that you want. You make me so happy.
